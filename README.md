# Average-Rating-per-Course-by-Month
A program that accepts a dataframe object, which in this case is a table containing individual reviews for various Python Courses.
The data is then manipulated to create a different 'Month' column - from the already existing 'Timestamp' column. This new column only contains the year and month number. 
Afterwards the data is grouped by 'Month' and 'Course Name', and the mean rating for course each month is found. 
A chart is then created to visualize this using Justpy and Highcharts.
